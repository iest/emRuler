*A super simple em unit ruler.*

## Instructions

Simply link to both `emRuler.js` and `emRuler.css` in your document head.

The code is fully commented, so feel free to minify if 909bytes is too big...


## Caveats
Since there's no reliable way to figure out the body font size of the browser, it gets hard coded right at the top of `emRuler.js`, as `bodyFontSize`.

(Most browsers have 16px as the default, so that's what it defaults to).
