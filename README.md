*A super simple em unit ruler.*

## Instructions

1. Copy the raw text from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iest/emRuler/master/bookmarklet.js))
2. Create a new bookmark
3. Paste in the javascript to the address field. (You might have to add a dummy bookmark first, then go back and edit it)
4. Click the bookmark to enable & disable the ruler

It rounds to the nearest em unit on purpose â€” pixel perfection doesn't exist on the web ;)
